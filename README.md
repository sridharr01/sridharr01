## Research Direction

My work explores hardware-first approaches to computation using controlled electromagnetic interactions, investigating non-conventional computing primitives beyond traditional transistor-based logic.

---

## Current Focus

- Induction-based logic experimentation
- Hardware-level adaptive computing concepts
- Prototype-stage architectural development

Primary project:
- **Induction-Coupling Architecture (ICA)**
